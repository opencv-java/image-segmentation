## Image Segmentation with OpenCV and JavaFX

*Computer Vision course - [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it) - academic year 2014-2015*

A project, made in Eclipse (Luna), for experimenting with edge detection, erosion and dilatation. It performs image segmentation upon a webcam video stream.

Please, note that the project is an Eclipse project, made for teaching purposes. Before using it, you need to install the OpenCV library (version 2.4.9) and JavaFX (version 2 or superior) and create a `User Library` named `opencv2` that links to the OpenCV jar and native libraries.
